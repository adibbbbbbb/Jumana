                This website was transformed from a resort-themed template into
                a unique representation of the Foxy Tribe. Key changes include
                replacing the original resort-related pages with custom content
                about the tribe, such as their history, characters, and
                adventures. Unnecessary sections like "Rooms," "Dive Site,"
                "Food," and "News" were removed to streamline the navigation.
                The CSS was updated to introduce a rich earthy color palette,
                rounded image styles, and a simplified layout for improved
                readability. New sections were added, including a detailed
                "About" page and a gallery showcasing key members of the tribe.
                These updates breathe life into the Foxy Tribe's story while
                preserving the structure of the original template.

              <h2>The Story of Foxy Tribe</h2>
              <p>
                In a remote village, the Foxy Tribe flourishes under the
                leadership of Ali, the tribe's king, and his wife Gretha. Ali is
                a wise leader who has united the villagers with his
                compassionate yet firm rule. Gretha, with her sharp wit and
                caring demeanor, ensures that every villager feels part of the
                tribe's family.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among the villagers is Darshan, who serves as the king's loyal
                yet underappreciated slave. While performing his duties, Darshan
                meets Chico, a spirited girl from a neighboring tribe. Drawn by
                their shared desire for freedom, Darshan and Chico decide to
                escape their tribes, embarking on an adventurous journey to
                carve out a new life for themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their journey takes an unexpected turn when they encounter Feez,
                the tribe’s number one stalker. Feez, who has a knack for
                observing villagers’ lives, had been following them from a
                distance. Realizing their plight, Feez decides to help Darshan
                and Chico escape the Foxy Tribe and start anew. Not only does he
                guide them through treacherous terrain, but he also arranges
                their marriage, ensuring their happily-ever-after.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Foxy Tribe, though small, remains a place where stories
                unfold, friendships thrive, and every villager has a role in the
                tapestry of life.
